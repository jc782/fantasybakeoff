<h2>How to play</h2>
<br>
<b>The concept</b>
<p>It's super simple; you watch the bakeoff and decide on what order you think the bakers are going to be sent home. After the second episode you enter your team, which is simply a ranking of the remaining bakers.</p>
<p>Your fantasy team will be compared to the order Mary and Paul send the bakers home. A score (0-100%)* will determine how well you've correlated with the correct order.</p>
<br>
<b>The Rules</b>
<p>It's pretty self explanatory. But incase of rogue decisions by Paul and Mary, the 'order' the bakers are sent home will be determined by the Wikipedia Bake Off series 7 elimination table order, as determined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off_(series_7)" target="_blank">here.</a>

<br>
<b>The Prize</b>
Correct prediction of the entire order will merit a prize. Prize tbc.

<p>You can setup and join leagues to play against friends.</p>
